Hello readers!

The world is under the grip of a devastating virus which has made its presence felt in more than 210 countries by now and still counting. COVID 19 has taught us quite a few lessons - that even the most powerful country will succumb, that no age, sex, cast, religion, or economy can escape the fury, that no celebrity, king, PM, or President is infallible, and that no one is invincible! The virus is here to stay; our endurance and courage to face it is what matters.

Healthcare workers are the new heroes of the world and family physicians play a pivotal role in containing the pandemic. Hence the recently celebrated world family doctors day had the theme – “Family doctors on the frontline - first in, last out”. One such recognition which came to AFPI Karnataka was from the prestigious Rajiv Gandhi University Of Health Sciences, when they invited us as resource persons to conduct a webinar on “Practice and management of clinics for GPs” on March 27, 2020 as part of their ongoing series. 

We take pride in launching the second issue (in volume 4) of our regular newsletter. This edition has a variety of thought provoking and enlightening articles - the uncertainties and challenges of running a private clinic during the pandemic, the art of being a lifelong learner, models of community health in the eyes of a public health MD candidate, reflection on healthcare delivery in India, novel cancer therapy and lots more. Please give our young and energetic team your sincere feedback to improve on what we have been doing since past 4 years. 

Happy reading. Stay safe! Stay strong!
