More than 70 doctors participated in the cafe and family doctors from 11 states shared their experience in caring for families during COVID-19. Participants were from across the states and included senior physicians like Dr BC Rao and young physicians as well.

Dr Piyush Jain shared about the challenges and shifts in thinking and practice that has happened in caring for people with chronic illness and non-communicable diseases. 

It was refreshing to take a pause and reflect on our practices, emotions that our patients and ourselves are going through, and what to expect going forward. It also brought the sense of  collective learning and togetherness among the warriors in the current battle.
