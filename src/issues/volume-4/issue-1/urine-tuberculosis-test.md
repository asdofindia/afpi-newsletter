Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a component of the cell wall shed by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Tests based on the detection of LAM in urine have emerged as potential point-of-care tests for TB. Urine-based testing would have advantages over sputum-based testing because urine is easy to collect and store, and lacks the infection control risks associated with sputum collection.[^1]

Earlier the test methods were able to detect LAM only in the urine of patients who were HIV positive and had active tuberculosis. But, researchers have been able to develop [newer method that can detect LAM in urine of patients who are negative for HIV test](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/420/eaal2807) as well.[^2]

This new test will hopefully be available in India soon.
