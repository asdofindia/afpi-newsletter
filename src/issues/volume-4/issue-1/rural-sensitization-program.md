The Rural Sensitization Program is an experiential learning process for medical students, postgraduates and young doctors to expose them to rural perspectives. You will talk to health workers, farmers, craftsman, villagers to understand their stories and experiences. Through the observations, individual and group reflections and discussions, we hope that we can draw out together a broader map of the countryâ€™s health problems and ways of addressing them.
