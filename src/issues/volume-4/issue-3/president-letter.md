Hello Readers! 

2020 is more than half way through and covid is still playing spoilsport; with no end in sight for at least the next few months .  Medical practice and education has morphed with many new normals like teleconsultations , webinars  etc being widely accepted as the way forward. 

We at AFPI Karnataka have also adapted to these and have started a series of webinars catering to the need of practicing family physicians. The first one on “ management of COVID in general practice” was a huge success and we hope to cover many interesting and need of the hour topics in our journey forward.  Another milestone achieved by us was the opening of the first of its kind “AFPI family practice centre” which aims at nurturing and supporting upcoming family physicians through a collective and collaborative approach. Please read through the activities done by the organization in the past few months and give a feedback on ways to improve and incorporate methods to further strengthen our fraternity. AFPI strives to keep the ethics and integrity of family practice intact and help in updating knowledge of its members and all general practitioners.  

Hope this issue also gives you though provoking read. Kindly put forth your thoughts and suggestions if any to us. Happy reading!
