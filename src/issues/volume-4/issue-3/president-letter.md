Hello Readers!

Wishing you, family and friends a happy, safe and healthy new year 2021! Although covid seems to be playing hide and seek over the past few weeks, medical practice has been going on, accepting the new normals like “socially distanced non touch consults” teleconsultations , webinars etc.

We at AFPI Karnataka have also adapted to these and have started a series of webinars catering to the need of practicing family physicians. The first one on “management of COVID in general practice” was a huge success and we did cover many interesting and need of the hour topics in our journey through 2020. Another milestone achieved by us was the opening of the first of its kind “AFPI family practice centre” which aims at nurturing and supporting upcoming family physicians through a collective and collaborative approach. The involvement of AFPI Karnataka members in mentoring students for “Fellowship of Family Medicine” conducted by St John’s Medical College has also been well appreciated by their faculty.  Please read through the activities done by the organization in the past one year and give your valuable feedback on ways to improve and incorporate methods to further strengthen our fraternity. AFPI strives to keep the ethics and integrity of family practice intact and help in updating knowledge of its members and all general practitioners.

Hope this issue also gives you though provoking read. Kindly put forth your thoughts and suggestions if any to us. Happy reading!
