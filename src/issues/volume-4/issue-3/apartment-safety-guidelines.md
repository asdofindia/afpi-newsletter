Welcome to 2020, where corona is not just a beer, where social distancing is more popular than social drinking, where the whole mahabharat TV series ended before a lockdown could. We have reached a stage where masks and social distancing are part of our everyday lives and the overflow of opinions on “do’s and dont’s” has led people into a frenzy and confusion, especially in large housing complexes and apartments. This article helps to educate them about safe COVID prevention practices and how to implement them.

General preventive measures to be followed by all residents, staff and visitors- as below.

**Vulnerable population in the complex**: Children below 10 years, elders above 65 years, pregnant women and those with comorbities like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, cancers etc should be encouraged to stay at home as much as possible with minimum exposure.

Start by implementing the following steps which are simple yet is paramount to ensure the safety of the residents.

* The contact numbers of local government health officers designated for COVID duty/ ambulance services/ nearest fever clinics/ and COVID treatment centers should be available with the office bearers of the RWA. These numbers should be prominently displayed on the notice boards.
* The RWA should also put posters and information on COVID prevention and management in prominent places for residents/ visitors to see familiarize.
* Avoid both external visits & visitors as far as feasible.
* Educate housekeeping and security staff about safety measures so as to ease implementation. Keep doing regular practice sessions for the staff to ensure their compliance.
* The presence of a doctor/ nurse/ healthcare worker in the complex can be utilized to conduct regular webinars or other educational services for the apartment dwellers on safety measures to prevent and manage COVID
* Reduce the number of staff members and keep only essential workers- Preferable to keep them in shifts to help reduce the total number of staff at a given time.
* Supply soap/disinfectant to all workers & security for their use.
* Provide masks for security personnel at the gate as well as mask/gloves for the housekeeping staff.
* Avoid use of biometric devices.
* Thermal scanning of all visitors to be done at the entrance and only then to be permitted inside the premises.
* It is ideal if the apartment can adopt a “no touch” method of entry to any guest who comes in using an OTP instead of a register with the help of apps dedicated for the same.
* Installation of Aarogya setu app to be advised for all residents and compulsory viewing of their status should be done for individuals entering the apartment.
* Encourage self monitoring of health and report any illness to state/ district/ local helpline.
* Ensure proper handwash practices/ provide sanitizer for all incoming guests
* Regular disinfection of elevators, handrails & commonly touched surfaces with 7% Lysol or 1% hypochlorite solution.  
Method of preparation of hypochlorite solution – add 28.4 grams of normal bleaching powder to 1 litre of water and keep for one hour. Remove the supernatant liquid for use into a spraying bottle. Try to disinfect 2-3 times in a day or more according to the frequency of usage.
* Encourage use of stairways instead of lifts as much as possible
* Limit the number of individuals in the elevator and maintain social distancing inside it.
* Reduced group activities for kids/parents inside the apartment complex.
* Preferable to advise against usage of swimming pools/ play areas/ gym etc
* Seating arrangements of common areas like parks to be strictly arranged following social distancing norms.
* AC/ ventilation of common areas – temperature setting of all ACs should be between 24-30 degrees, , relative humidity should be in the range of 40-70%, recirculation of air has to be avoided as far as possible and cross ventilation should be good for fresh air to be circulating in the area.
* Make sure that you are eating healthily. Exercise regularly inside your apartment as it boosts immunity.
* Educate maids and other helpers to inform and avoid coming to work in case of any suspected symptoms of COVID like fever, sore throat, cough, breathing difficulty, diarrhea, severe weakness etc.

Furthermore, CDC recommends the following for those with any special needs- such as older adults, people with disabilities, and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions.
* Contact their family physician/ healthcare provider and get additional medications to have on hand for a longer period of time.
* Ensure that residents are aware of serious symptoms of their underlying conditions and of COVID symptoms that prompt emergency care.
* Encourage elderly and dependent residents who live alone to seek out a “buddy” in the facility who will check on, help, care for them and make sure they are getting basic necessities, including food and household essentials
* Consider cancelling all public or non-essential group activities, meetings and events while offering alternative methods such as participation by phone, online, or through recorded sessions.

If there is a positive case in your apartment –
 
* DO NOT PANIC AND OSTRACIZE THE RESIDENT.
* Make sure the concerned authorities or your family physician is informed immediately
* He/she should be assessed by healthcare workers and decision on home/ institutional management is to be taken.
* Arrange for supply of essentials/ food/medications for them.
* Disinfect the floor and common areas regularly.
* Continue all the precautions to prevent spread in the living community.
* Cooperate with the local health authorities for surveillance and contact tracing.
* For larger communities the club house or a similar place can be utilized to create a COVID care centre (CCC) or an isolation centre with the help of local health authorities. This will help to cater for positive asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients who can then live close to home.

RWA should facilitate all the above, follow the government health updates, educate the residents and prevent dissipation of myths and rumors to give confidence to all the inmates.

REMEMBER- Together we can fight the enemy!

STAY AT HOME- STAY SAFE!
