HELLO READERS!

The year 2021 is coming to an end in a few weeks and what we look forward to in the coming year is the hope for a covid free world.  The past year has been a mixture of emotional and physical turmoil for most of us who were in the forefront of the battle against the dreaded virus. Family physicians played a pivotal role in the country’s victory against the pandemic - which has made the government, NGOs and public acknowledge and take note of our contributions. Let us keep this momentum going by continuing to keep our patients in good physical and mental health and be their guide through good and bad times. 

This year has been very eventful for AFPI Karnataka with various activities throughout the year. The most important of them was our second state conference held in collaboration with the prestigious St John’s Medical College at their campus. The conference was unique in two aspects - the first of its kind hybrid one, and the active involvement of undergraduate students from MSAI and SIMSA! The graduation of the second batch of students of St John’s FFM (Fellowship in Family Medicine) in collaboration with AFPI was held at St. John's. The second batch of graduates from the Primary Healthcare Leadership Fellowship run by AFPI with Karuna Trust was held at Karuna Trust's office. The feedback from the graduating fellows has been very positive which has resulted in the current year admissions to double from the past year. We were invited by the VC of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences as guest speakers for their monthly webinar on home based COVID management. Dialogues with the University  for start of MD – FM programs in other colleges are also being initiated. The motto of the organization in promoting family medicine will be continued through many more such initiatives with the support of our esteemed members. 

2022 comes with more events to look forward to – the most important being the 5th FMPC to be held at Hyderabad in February.  Please join our Telangana team and make the event a grand success by your active presence. Also looking forward to get meaningful contributions from all the readers for our upcoming newsletters in the form of practice anecdotes, research papers, medical news updates and other information that can enhance family practice. 

Hope this issue too gives you good insights and thought provoking material. Happy reading!
