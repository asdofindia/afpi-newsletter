## The Search for an Alternative ##

I attach great importance to the word ‘alternative’ in the theme of this
oration. Let me, therefore, explain in some detail what I have in mind. 

When we became free, we decided to expand and improve the health 
services of the country as one part of a comprehensive package of programmes then undertaken to raise the standards of living of the people. 
Our approach to the problem, however, was rather simplistic. We adopted 
the western model of health services which, we thought, was ideally suited 
for our country. It may be pointed out that our doctors were then being 
trained in institutions which maintained standards comparable to those 
in England and thus got an automatic right to practice or serve in the 
U.K. The basic emphasis in this model was on the adoption of the latest 
medical technology developed in the West and to make it available to the 
people of this country through, 

— the expansion of the bureaucratic machinery of the medical and 
public health departments, 

— the expansion of the institutions of medical education to train the 
agents required for the delivery of health care (such as doctors or 
nurses), 

— the creation of the necessary infrastructure needed for the purpose 
from the big hospitals in metropolitan cities to the primary health 
centres and dispensaries in rural areas, and 

— the indigenous production of the essential drugs and chemicals 
required. 

There is no doubt that we have achieved a good deal during the last 30 years if judged by the targets we thus set before ourselves.
There is now a 
huge Ministry of Health and Family Planning at the Centre and large departments of public health and medical services in the States. The doctor still remains the principal agent of health care and there has inevitably been a concentration on his training. As against 15 medical colleges with an admission capacity of about 1,200 per year in 1947, we now 
have 106 colleges with an admission capacity of about 12,500 per annum.
The standards of training were also ‘upgraded’ with the abolition of the 
shorter licenciate course and the introduction of a uniform course of 4½
years (after 12 years of schooling) for the first medical degree. The facilities for training other functionaries — whose categories have greatly 
multiplied - were also increased substantially so that we are not far from 
the norms proposed by the Bhore Committee. A huge infrastructure of 
hospitals, Primary Health Centres and their subcentres, and dispensaries 
has also been built up. The pharmaceutical industry has been developed 
almost from a scratch. It now produces several life-saving drugs and its 
output has increased from about Rs. 10 crores a year in 1947 to about Rs. 
105 crores a year at present. There has also been immense progress in the 
control of communicable diseases such as cholera, malaria and small-pox. 
That there is considerable improvement in the health status of the people 
due to all these measures, is established by three main indices, viz., the increase in life expectancy from about 32 years in 1947 to about 52 years at 
present, the fall in death rate from about 27.4 per thousand in 1947 to 
about 11.3 per thousand at present, and the decline in infant mortality 
from about 160 per thousand live births in 1947 to about 125 per thousand 
live births at present. 

Impressive as these achievements are — and we have every right to be 
proud of them — it is also realized that our failures are even more glaring 
For instance, we have found that the present system provides health care 
services mostly in the urban areas and for well-to-do people and that it 
does not reach the poor people in rural areas and urban slums. The funds 
required to extend these services to these excluded groups will be almost 
astronomically large and there is no possibility of getting them within the 
foreseeable future. There is considerable dissatisfaction about the education of doctors. We are also not sure of what kind of a doctor we need, 
how to train him, and even more importantly, how to harness him to the 
service of the rural areas or poor people. The same can be said of other 
functionaries as well. The infrastructure we have built is also mostly urban 
and beyond a few pilot experiments - whose value and capability for 
generalization are still in question — we do not have clear ideas about the 
infrastructure and health care delivery agents needed for rural areas. The 
system is still over-weighted in favour of curative programmes in spite of 
the clear conviction that, in our present situation, it is the preventive, 
socio-economic and educational aspects of health care systems that are the 
most significant. What is even more important, we are no longer sure that 
the western model we adopted is really suited to us, especially as its basic 
premises are now being challenged in the West itself by thinkers like 
Ivan Illich. We have also realized that no bureaucracy, however large and 
efficient, can be a substitute for the active involvement and education of 
the people in programmes of health improvement. In short, after thirty 
years of development of health services, we find ourselves in the position 
of a traveller who sets out on a long journey, and even before he has 
travelled about three-tenths of the distance to his goal, finds that his purse 
has been stolen, his car has developed serious trouble and grave doubts 
have arisen even abqpt the correctness of the route he had decided to 
follow. 

Therefore, I find a qualitative difference in the situation in the last five 
years. Earlier, the assumption at least was that we are on the right track 
and that all that was needed was a good deal more of the same thing , and 
that we would be able to achieve our goals if more funds were provided 
and the quality of implementation were improved. Today, there is a growing awareness that what we need is not ‘more of the same’ but something 
‘qualitatively different’. This is what I mean by the search of an alternative; and the Report of the Srivastava Committee is perhaps the first 
recognition that some alternative or alternatives are needed. I am very 
happy that we have begun to grapple with this basic problem in right 
earnest. I hope we will continue this effort intensively over the next two 
years and succeed in evolving a viable alternative, economic, health care 
policy which can become the core of the Sixth Five Year Plan. All that I 
aspire to do in this oration, with your kindness and collaboration, is to 
make some contribution to promote this extremely significant national 
endeavour. 


## The Basic Issues ##


Let me preface my detailed and concrete proposals on the subject, which 
I will discuss in the following section, by a statement of what I consider 
to be the three basic issues of development in all sectors of our life to 
which the development of health care systems is no exception. 


The first refers to the fundamental question of the type of society we 
want to create in India. Mahatma Gandhi was convinced that we would 
have to evolve our own model of such a society in keeping with our traditions, present conditions, needs, and future aspirations. “Let the winds 
from all comers of the world blow in through the windows of my house”, 
he said, “but I refuse to be blown off my feet by any”. He also initiated a 
dialogue on the kind of society we must create and sustained it throughout his life. But unfortunately that dialogue disappeared with him; and 
we have almost equated ‘modernization’ with ‘westernization’ and are con- 
tent with the introduction of a pale imitation of western models in our 
country. But social models cannot be so transferred, and even if they are, 
they will hardly be useful. There is, therefore, no escape from the earnest 
intellectual exercise of deciding for ourselves the kind of society we would 
like to have and the model of health care systems that we should build up. 
In this, we may be guided by the experience of the West (or of the whole 
world) but not conditioned by it. 

The second issue refers to the dichotomy between our professed goals 
which are explicitly stated and to which generous lip sympathy is paid in 
season and out of season, and the hidden implicit goals which we really 
pursue. Before independence, we made a number of solemn pledges to the 
people of India in whose name we fought for political independence, 
viz., that we shall abolish poverty, ignorance and ill health and raise substantially the standards of living of the masses. In the euphoria of freedom, 
we also embodied these assurances in the Constitution whose Preamble 
commits us to the creation of a new social order based on freedom, equality, 
justice and dignity of the individual. These, therefore, are our professed 
goals; and the attainment of independence places our well-to-do educated 
classes (who now hold all the positions of power surrendered by 
the British authorities) on trial by challenging them to achieve 
these objectives. We are also compelled to pay lip sympathy to these 
goals because we have adopted a system of parliamentary democracy 
which forces us to solicit the votes of the people and because we find it 
convenient and easy to do so on these populist slogans. But the achievement of these goals is not an easy thing and it is also not in our immediate 
self-interest to do so. We therefore, adopt hidden and implied goals of 
pursuing our own class-interest. This is understandable (but not excusable) because a ruling class rules, first and foremost, for its own benefit 
and only incidentally for that of others. Thus develops a dichotomy 
wherein we talk of serving the masses of people, the Daridranarayanct of 
India, while in reality we are more busy than ever in aggrandizement for 
the benefit of our own classes. In fact, we have converted this very dichotomy into a fine art so that, today, the best and the quickest way to become rich and powerful is to follow in the footsteps of the Mahatma and 
to offer one’s life to the service of the Daridranarayana . It is necessary 
that we abandon this double-think and double-talk and devote ourselves 
in all earnestness to create an egalitarian society in India. 

The third issue refers to the first steps and the process through which 
this egalitarian transformation can be brought about. When it comes to 
the discussion of an egalitarian and more just international economic 
order, we lose no time in declaring that no such transformation is possible 
unless the rich nations first cut down their artificially inflated standards 
of living (which are not good for them, either) and that we must accept 
a ‘mini-max’ philosophy under which no one gets less than what is needed 
for decent human existence just as no one is allowed to have an affluence 
beyond a certain level which also degrades. Exactly the same principle 
applies to the national situation also. But here we want to proceed on 
the assumption that the maintenance and continuous levelling up of the 
standards of living of the well-to-do must have the first priority on all 
development plans and that the programme of providing even the minimum levels of living for the underprivileged and the poor should be 
attempted to the extent possible after the demands of the well-to-do are 
first met. The problems of developing countries like India cannot be 
solved with this approach; and we must be prepared to share poverty with 
the people and deliberately and voluntarily agree to cut down our conspicuous consumption, our unnecessary expenditure and our affluent ‘necessaries’ in order that the poor may have some fair deal. This, let me emphasize, is not a policy against the well-to-do classes. In fact, it is the only 
policy in support of their enlightened self-interest and the larger interests 
of the country as a whole. What Gandhiji meant by his doctrine of 
‘trusteeship’ was the adoption of this policy by the ruling classes, voluntarily and willingly. 

At present, our policies are mainly directed to the borrowing of some 
western model or the other and to advance the well-being of the well-to-do classes, in spite of all our populist slogans to the contrary. If the three 
basic shifts in policies discussed here are not made, we shall be continuing 
the same old class-oriented programmes based on the adoption of wrong 
technologies, with marginal changes which will deceive none and which 
will achieve but little in improving the conditions of the deprived groups. 
It is, therefore, obvious that out search for alternatives in health care 
systems must be based on these three unexceptionable principles. 

## Linkages with Other Sectors ##

No system of health care can be considered in isolation. For instance, 
the health status of a people at any given time will depend upon several 
factors such as the following:-

— Health care systems are obviously related to concepts of health and 
disease. For instance, the health care systems in a society which believes 
that all sickness arises from the wrath of gods or evil spirits will be 
different from those in a society where illness is held to arise from material causes which need a treatment in tangible, material terms. Similarly, the health care system in a society which believes in individual 
responsibility for health through proper exercise, regular habits and 
self-control will be different from that in a society where the individual 
is allowed every license and its evil results are attempted to be corrected 
through medical or other intervention. Similarly, attitudes to pain, 
ageing or death also determine the nature of health care systems. 

— Health care systems also depend upon ecological factors. We need pure 
and fresh air, good and safe drinking water, adequate drainage and 
proper disposal of night soil, proper housing and adequate arrangements 
or immunization and control of communicable diseases, if illness is to 
be prevented, and if satisfactory conditions are to be created where we 
can hold the individual fully responsible for his health. 

— Health status and hence health care systems, also depend upon social 
and economic factors such as the organisation of the home and family, 
equality or otherwise of the sexes, social stratification, general conditions of work and poverty which increases proneness to disease while 
decreasing the capacity to combat it. 

— Health is closely related to nutrition and depends upon such factors 
as the quality and adequacy of food supplies, dietary habits and concepts and culinary and food preservation practice. 

— Health care systems are also obviously related to the technology of medicine and to our knowledge of and ability to deal with the malfunctioning 
of the body. 

— Health is also closely related to the spread of education among the people 
because an individual’s understanding of health, his capacity to remain 
healthy and his ability to deal with illness are all conditional upon the 
level of his education. The nature of health care system in a society 
where every individual receives a good basic education will therefore be 
very different from that in another society where the bulk of the people 
is illiterate. 


Some of these factors fall within the sphere of health services and will 
be discussed here in some detail. Others like nutrition, poverty, or general 
education of the people are obviously important but fall outside the 
limited scope of this oration. It is, however, obvious that a good system of 
health services cannot be built in isolation. It will have to be an integral 
part of a wider programme to improve the standards of living of the people 
and will have to be linked to programmes of abolishing poverty, achieving 
larger production and better distribution of food (including proper storage and improved dietary and culinary practices), and universal basic 
education. Family planning will, on the one hand, help the adoption of 
such an integrated approach, and on the other, it is the adoption of this 
comprehensive approach that will facilitate and promote a good programme of family planning. 


## Some General Conditions ##

No single individual can be expected to produce an alternative plan 
for the health care systems of our country. This is essentially an institutional 
and group task. I am, therefore, sure that you do not expect me to place 
such a plan before you. But you would be justified in expecting that I 
would at least place before you a few broad principles on which the alternative plans should be based and that I at least initiate a dialogue on the 
basis of which the preparation of such a plan (or plans) can be undertaken by appropriate groups and agencies in due course. It is precisely this 
that I shall attempt to do in the limited time at my disposal and place 
a ten-point programme before you for detailed examination. 

### 1. Target Groups ### 

My first proposal in this context is that we 
should state, beyond any shadow of doubt, who the beneficiaries of these 
alternative systems of health care will be. We should also ensure that these 
proposed systems will not be so implemented that their benefits again go 
to those very groups who receive the lion's share of health care under the 
existing system. 

Our developmental experience in the last thirty years shows that we 
have often gone wrong on both these counts. Several of our schemes of 
production (e.g. cocoa cola, canned or readymade foods, cosmetics, automobiles, cigarettes or superfine cloth) were meant to produce not the 
essential basic consumer goods required by the masses but the luxury and 
semi-luxury goods needed by the well-to-do classes. The largest beneficiaries 
of the development of science and technology and of our industrial development based on the concept of import-substitution, have, therefore, been 
the middle and the upper classes and not the masses of the people. On the 
other hand, several schemes which were originally planned with the object 
of helping the poor and deprived groups were so distorted in implementation that their benefits also went to the well-to-do. For instance, many 
a scheme of helping the Adivasis or landless labourers through employment or subsidies resulted merely in passing funds to the money-lender 
or rich peasant who exploited the Adivasi or landless labourer. The fishing 
industry in Kerala developed with Norwegian collaboration was originally 
intended to improve the diets of poor fishermen. But when it adopted 
high technology, it naturally wished to make adequate profits and with 
this objective in view, it concentrated on catching prawns. While these 
prawns continued to be eaten in Tokyo, Paris, London, Bombay, or Delhi 
and the industry made huge profits, the diet of the poor fishermen (whom 
the scheme was to benefit) continued to be the same or even became worse. 

Such distortions were found within the health care services as well. If 
contributory health insurance schemes were to be introduced on a selective basis, the Central Government Employees are certainly not the most 
eligible group of citizens to be covered first under the scheme which involves a heavy subsidy. Even within the scheme, the per capita expenditure on the senior officers (deputy-secretary and above) is much larger 
than that on the class IV employees. The same can be said of all the infrastructure of big hospitals and super-specialities which benefit largely the 
well-to-do. We expanded the facilities for the training of doctors on the 
plea that they are needed for rural areas. But our actual experience is 
that the majority of the doctors we train go abroad or settle down in urban 
areas. The trained A.N.M. attached to the Community Development 
Block was meant to help the poor families. But she has actually become 
handmaiden to the rich and powerful rural elite. Similarly, several schemes 
meant specifically for rural areas and the poorer people have made no 
headway in practice. For instance, the programme of training village Dais 
has continued to languish; and as Professor Banerji points out in his ad- 
mirable booklet on Formulating an Alternative Rural Health Care System 
for India (pp. 7-8) “In 1963, a Government of India Committee recommended that rural populations may be provided integrated health and 
family planning services through male and female multipurpose workers.[^1] But the, clash of interests of malaria and family planning campaigns soon 
led to the reversion to unipurposes workers. In 1973, yet another committee revived the idea of providing integrated health and family planning services through multipurpose workers.[^2] This time also the prospect 
of effective implementation of the scheme does not appear to be very 
bright. Earlier, there had been at least two more efforts, both similarly 
abortive, to develop alternative health strategies. One, the so-called Master 
Plan of Health Services envisaged (in 1970) more incentives to physicians, 
establishment of 25-bed hospitals and use of mobile dispensaries for remote and difficult rural areas.[^3] The other, apparently inspired by the institution of Barefoot Doctors of China, was to mobilise an estimated 
200,000 Registered Medical Practitioners of different systems of medicine 
as “Peasant Physicians” to serve as rural health workers”[^4]

During the British period, our health care systems were based on the 
idea of making modern medical and health technology available to a class 
of people who were well-to-do and mostly urban. In spite of all that we 
have said to the contrary, the same policy has been continued substantially 
during the last thirty years. Even today, about 70 per cent, of the people 
do not have access to even the most elementary health care services. This 
cannot be allowed to continue; and one acid test of all proposals for alternatives should be that they should really benefit, in planning as well as 
in implementation, the poor and deprived people living in rural areas or 
urban slums. The talisman that Gandhiji suggested is very relevant in this 
context; whenever one has to decide the priority or desirability of a plan, 
one must always relate it to the extent to which it will actually benefit 
the poorest and the lowliest of the low. 

### 2. Emphasis on Preventive and Protective Aspects ###

My second proposal is that the new health care systems we propose to develop as alternatives should move away from the over-emphasis which the existing systems place on mere curative measures and must place a much 
greater emphasis on preventive and protective measures to which a 
large bulk of the available resources should be devoted. For instance, our 
achievements in making better nutrition available to the people are by 
no means impressive; and even today, very large sections of people go without adequate food. It is true that the total available food supply has increased. But the production of coarse foodgrains, on which the poor people 
mostly live, has not kept pace with the increase in the numbers of the 
poor. We have hardly any system of public food distribution in rural areas 
(outside Kerala). Nor have we made any sizable impact on the capacity of 
the poor to buy food in the market. Provision of protected water supply 
has been made for four-fifths of the urban population but nearly 120,000 
villages with a population of more than 60 million people do not still have 
even the most elementary water-supply system. Sewerage exists only for 
40 per cent of the urban population. Most medium and small towns have 
no sewerage systems and in the rural areas, the programmes of drainage 
and sewerage are nowhere in sight. It is true that considerable progress 
has been made in the control of cholera, small-pox and malaria. These 
gains need to be conserved and developed further. But the prevalence of 
infections in general and intestinal infections in particular is still large; 
and in several areas, a vicious circle has already been established; infection 
leading to malnutrition and malnutrition in its turn leading to increased 
proneness to infection. It may be asserted without fear of contradiction 
that under the present conditions in India, protective and preventive measures are even more important than curative ones. The alternative plans 
we propose to develop must, therefore, lay a greater emphasis on them. 

### 3. Choice of Technology ###

The third basic issue in which the alternative plans blaze a new trail is that of health and medical technology. 
The policy adopted so far, and this is true of all spheres of life including 
health, has been to consider technology as sacrosanct and above all laws. 
We have always tried to introduce in India the most highly developed 
technology the world has discovered on the assumption that our people 
should have nothing less than the absolutely first-rate available anywhere 
else in the world. As the over-riding principles in the choice of technology 
are its modernity and advanced character (and not suitability to the 
people), we generally expect the people to adjust themselves to technology 
rather than the other way round. These policies, I am sorry to say, have 
been proved to be wrong and counter-productive. It is now universally 
agreed that technology cannot be an end in itself. It can only be a means to 
an end, viz,, the welfare and growth of the people so that we must choose a 
technology best suited to the interests of the people and not expect the 
people to adjust themselves to the technology. Secondly, we have now learnt 
that the choice of technology is extremely crucial because it affects priorities, target groups, investment levels, and the character of the delivery 
agents. A higher level of technology requires a larger investment; it needs 
a more highly trained and sophisticated delivery agent; and its benefits 
tend to accrue to a smaller and more privileged social group. It is, therefore, our decision to adopt the best health and medical technology available in the world that has led to the creation of the present system of 
health care services in the country, oriented to the well-to-do classes and 
which is in the words of Professor V. Ramalingaswamy, over-centralized, 
over-expensive, over-professionalized, over-urbanized and over-modified. [^5]

[^5]: It should be noted that a decision to climb upwards in the technological ladder leads exactly to the same results in other fields of life as well. For instance, a bicycle can be used by every one; but the use of faster means of transport continually increases costs, needs more sophisticated personnel and restricts the beneficiaries. 

The question, therefore, is whether it is always necessary for us to ‘soar’
upwards in the technological ladder as we have done. That this is not 
absolutely essential is evident from several important experiments. The 
Chinese developed a workable system of health care oriented to the 
people, with the help of barefoot doctors. Cuba did an equally creditable 
job with unsophisticated personnel. Garl Taylor trained illiterate Muslim 
women in Noakhali to perform tubectomy. In our own country. Dr. Raj 
Arole at Jamkhed has trained illiterate village women to take care of 70 
per cent of the common illnesses of the local community. Dr. C. Gopalan 
is prepared to train the village teachers for the delivery of curative services for day-to-day illnesses. These illustrations lead to two conclusions. 
The first is that there are, as Wordsworth has pointed out, two types of 
the wise — those that ‘soar’ upwards to the stars and those that ‘roam’ far 
and wide on this our earth. We tried to ‘soar’ and the Chinese decided 
to ‘roam’. Perhaps it would be more correct to say that this is not really 
an ‘either-or’ issue and we must have both types of the wise, those who 
soar and those who roam, in a proper combination and a fruitful organisation dictated by the needs of the country. This is what the Chinese seem 
to have done while we decided only to soar. Secondly, it appears that even 
high technology lends itself to two kinds of treatment. We can mystify 
it and restrict its use to only a few highly sophisticated and professionalized individuals. On the other hand, we can demystify it and train even 
the unsophisticated non-professionals to handle it. The best illustration 
is that of the agricultural scientists who take, pride in demystifying even 
the highest technology and placing it in the hands of even illiterate farmers. 
Innovators like Carl Taylor, Raj Arole and Gopalan have shown that this 
can be done in the field of health services as well. Why can’t we have more 
of the same? 

Whatever the decision on this issue may be, let us not forget one significant factor, viz., the type of health care systems we develop will depend 
upon our choice of technology to be adopted. What we have done in the 
existing health care systems is that we first introduced, in a few of our 
metropolitan cities, a technology that existed in London and then tried 
to spread it to the ‘periphery’ where the mass of the people live. The 
attempt has failed and cannot succeed. Can we not instead begin with 
the local community and with such local technologies as already exist? 
This can be a real alternative. As Professor Banerji writes:

> “An obvious framework for suggesting an alternative to the existing 
approach of “selling” some technology to the people will be to start 
with the people. This will ensure that technology is harnessed to the 
requirements of the people, as seen by the people themselves — i.e. technology is subordinated to the people. This alternative enjoins that 
technology should be taken with the people, rather than people taken 
with technology by “educating” them. 

> “Based on their way of life, i.e. on their culture, people in different 
communities have evolved their own way of dealing with their health 
problems. This concept forms the starting point, indeed the very foundation of the suggested alternative for immediate action. People on 
their own, seek out measures to deal with their health problems. Meeting 
of the felt needs of the people which also happen to be epidemiologically 
assessed needs receives the top priority in such a framework for an alternative. People should not be “educated” to discard the measures that 
they have been adopting unless a convincing case is made to show that 
taking into account their own perspective of the problems and under 
the existing conditions of resource constraints, it is possible to have an 
alternative technology which will yield significantly greater benefits to 
people in terms of alleviation of the suffering that is caused by a health 
problem. 

> "As is the way of life, health behaviour of a community is a dynamic 
phenomenon; it changes with changes in the epidemiology of the health 
problems, available knowledge relating to such problems, availability of 
resources and other such considerations. Therefore, to be based on such a dynamic phenomenon, the alternative for immediate action is required 
to be correspondingly accommodative.”[^6] 

[^6]: Banerjee; op. cit., pp. 13-14. 

### 4. Agents of Health Care ###
The fourth issue relates to the nature of the agents we should select and train for health care services. 

The tradition in ancient India was that services needed by the people 
were provided by selected persons within the community itself, who generally worked on a part-time basis and provided their services, either free 
of charge or at a nominal cost which the people could afford. The village 
Dai is a good example of this pattern. She has survived to this day and 
is still delivering her services to 95 per cent child births in rural areas. 
There was thus specialisation without professionalization. The negative 
aspect of the situation was that the technology available was crude and did 
not grow. On the other hand, its positive features were that the services 
did reach the masses of the people and that their human aspects (which 
modern professionalism, has killed) were superb. 

Instead of trying to develop this model by preserving its strength and 
improving the level of its technology, we decided to ignore it altogether 
and adopt the western model of paid and full-time professionals to provide 
the health services (and other services as well). The village Dai was treated with contempt and was to be replaced by an A.N.M., the village Vaidya 
or a Hakim by a modern doctor, and so on. The main reason for this 
decision was the belief (and obviously uncritical belief) that the new and 
modern technology we wanted to introduce could not be taken to the people 
through these old agents; new wine needs new bottles. The consequences 
have been disastrous. The new professionals are so costly that we cannot 
afford to employ enough of them with the result that we provide these 
services only to a small group of well-to-do people. What is worse, the 
humane qualities of the old agents are more absent than present in these 
modern, technically more competent, but mercenary new agents. 

The hard choice we have to make is, therefore, clear: Should we go 
back to the old traditional model, or go ahead with the new model or 
combine both? We just do not have the resources to provide these modern 
agents of health to all our people. Nor can we totally ignore these modern 
health agents and their technical competence. We must not, therefore, 
regard this as an either-or issue. We need both the types in an appropriate combination. For instance, we just cannot provide A.N.Ms to all 
the deliveries in rural areas. This is also unnecessary. The village Dais 
must, therefore, be trained and utilized to provide usual antenatal and 
mid-wifery services. But they should be trained to detect, and refer in good 
time, all complicated cases to the PHC or other centres where more highly trained functionaries will deal with them. What is said of the midwifery services here will also apply to other services. Instead of mystifying 
the services and centering them in the hands of full-time professionals 
(which only implies that these services will be costlier and limited to a 
few), we should simplify the services into several components which can 
be efficiently managed by para-professionals and non-professionals and 
train people from within the community to deal with them. This modified 
form of de-professionalization is desirable, even if we had the money to 
provide professional services alone (rich countries which have relied exclusively on fully-paid professionals for basic services have regretted their 
decision and are trying to go back to the earlier stage) because it is a 
more humane way of doing things which gives a meaning to the lives of 
hundreds of workers. When we do not have the resources, there is no 
alternative to this at all. There need also be no fear that such carefully 
planned deprofessionalization will reduce standards. In fact the work of 
Taylor or Arole shows that it improves standards. That is why I would 
strongly urge the full implementation of the proposals made by the Srivastava Committee for the training of health agents at the community 
level from among the community itself. I, therefore, fully support the 
following proposals made by Prof. Banerji: 

> "Community members may be encouraged to make maximum use of 
self-care procedures through continued use of various home remedial 
measures. Services of locally available practitioners of various systems 
of medicines should be used as a supplement. Another supplementary 
community resource can be created by providing training to community 
selected primary health workers, who are specifically drawn from among 
the weaker sections, who can make available home remedies and remedies from the indigenous and western systems of medicine for meeting 
the medical care needs. Services of full-time health auxiliaries may be 
used only to tackle more complicated cases and those which need more 
specialised care.”[^7]

[^7]: D. Banerji, op. cit., pp. 14. 

Prof. Banerji makes this recommendation for medical care only. But it 
would apply to all categories of health services. 

### 5. Infrastructure ###

The fifth issue refers to the infrastructure that is 
needed to deliver health care to the people. Here I would like to high- 
light five points. 

increase this emphasis. But as we have seen, this only increases costs and 
(a) The existing infrastructure over-emphasises the provision of hospitals and specialities and super-specialities. The present trend also is to 
tends to benefit the well-to-do few. There is also evidence to show that a 
fairly large proportion of hospital beds are actually utilized few: cases 
which need not have been hospitalized. There is no point in adopting a 
target from western countries and say that we must have one hospital bed 
for so many people. This is no indicator of health at all and is not a model 
that suits us or we should follow. We should encourage a greater use of 
home for treating illness. The well-to-do may also be free to have private 
nursing homes if they so desire (it is senseless to control them). But the 
role of public-supported hospitals should be re-defined and de-emphasised. 
We may even refuse to set up new hospitals in urban areas and use the 
existing ones for the poorer people (the rich being compelled to go to 
private nursing homes). In the rural areas and smaller towns, however, 
small hospitals (or even mobile hospitals) may be encouraged. 

(b) The greatest weakness of the present infrastructure is that the area 
below the PHC is almost blank. Here we need to put in the largest effort. 
We must adopt the recommendation of the Srivastava Committee that a 
real primary health centre (or a mini health centre or a sub-centre) 
should have population of about 5,000 with two para-professional 
workers — one male and one female. They should work in close collaboration with several local health-workers for the community itself. The PHC 
can then function efficiently as an appex organisation for all these groups 
at the mini or sub-centres.

(c) The referral services need to be strengthened and streamlined 
so that every citizen has a reasonably equal opportunity to avail himself 
of the specialities or super-specialities he may need.

(d) The education programme needs a total overhaul. There should 
be a Medical and Health Education Commission as recommended by the 
Srivastava Committee. The training of the basic doctor needs over-hauling 
and its costs reduced. The over-emphasis on post-graduate work needs to 
be reconsidered. There is absolutely no justification to start any new medical colleges. In fact, some of the existing ones may be closed or converted 
to other uses. 

(e) Most important of all, we have to create institutions and channels for the training of thousands and thousands of the new health agents 
we need — the para-professionals and non-professionals. Special emphasis 
will have to be laid on the use of non-formal channels in those programmes. The status and quality of this training would have to be very high 
and appropriate bridges will have to be built between the training and 
the education of the professionals. 

### 6. Drugs ###
The adoption of modern health and medical technology 
also implies the production of modern drugs needed by the technology. 

A modern pharmaceutical industry is, therefore, an integral part of the 
modern health care systems. 

The progress made by the modern pharmaceutical industry in India 
can be briefly summarized as follows: 

(a) The pharmaceutical industry now produces drugs worth Rs. 450 crores (1975) as against Rs. 10 crores in 1947 — a phenomenal increase of 
45 times. It has achieved outstanding results in import substitution and 
also exports drugs worth about Rs. 25 crores. It has been able to secure 
collaboration with many advanced countries and has also developed a 
good research and development programme of its own. 

(b) There has been an expansion not only in the quantum of production but in its variety also. The drugs now manufactured by the industry cover a very wide therapeutic spectrum ranging from anti-biotics 
to vitamins. 

(c) The public sector represents 30% of the capital investment in this 
sector. It also represents 27 per cent in bulk drugs and 7 per cent in 
formulation. 

I would like to highlight three issues here: 

(a) In all developed countries, the pharmaceutical industry has become a vested interest in ill-health. It has set up a tremendous propa- 
ganda apparatus and uses the medical men practically as its salesmen. It 
is this vested interest which leads to a proliferation of drugs (where none 
is needed) , to increasing costs of drugs, to over-medication and to distortion of values. These are dangers of which we should be forewarned. 
These have already begun to appear in our midst; and we might do well 
to nip them in the bud. 

(b) I feel most irritated by the type of propaganda the drug industry 
puts up and we uncritically swallow. For instance, a beautiful brochure 
brought out by the industry emphasises that the consumption of drugs per 
head in India is Rs. 7.5 as against Rs. 310 in USA and observes : “The 
per capita consumption of drugs is a fairly reliable index of the State of 
development of the health care system judged by this standard, our country has a long way to go in this vital field.[^8] One cannot easily accept the 
view that the increasing consumption of drugs is an indication of better 
health. I do not also agree that the average Indian is in greater need of 
drugs than of food. I might also point out that the average citizen in USA 
spends about Rs. 35 on sleeping pills per year which is more than what 
we spend on the education of our average citizen. Very probably, we 
might reach the target of sleeping pills even before we achieve the targets 
in milk consumption or education. 

[^8]: Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, *The Nation's Health 
and Pharmaceutical Industry , Bombay* , 1976, p. 26. 

(c) We need a far more intensive effort to produce the common drugs 
needed by the people and to make them available at the cheapest prices 
possible. The present tendency to produce fancy and costly goods for the 
well-to-do has to be replaced by the mass production and cheap sale of 
drugs needed by the common man. 

### 7. Involvement of the People ###
One unfortunate aspect of the post-
independence administration is the over-emphasis on bureaucracy and 
failure to involve the people intimately in development. From 1921 to 
1947, Mahatma Gandhi had mobilized the people and involved them, not 
only in the national struggle for freedom, but also in several constructive 
programmes like removal of untouchability or promotion of village industries and handicrafts. If this tradition could have been continued and intensified in the post-independence period, the story of our development 
would have been entirely different. But somehow this was never done. The 
Government of free India expected only one thing from the people; they 
should vote them to power every five years. The Congress never built up 
cadres and never tried to organize mass movements round specific developmental issues and the opposition parties also did not do the effort and 
they did not also matter. Consequently, the full responsibility for the 
implementation of development plans was placed on the bureaucracy 
which increased several-fold in every sector. There is no doubt that the 
Indian bureaucracy is fairly efficient as bureaucracies in developing countries go. But the basic issue is that no bureaucracy, however large and efficient, can ever succeed in the proper implementation of the national plans 
of development on its own exclusive responsibility. Development means 
making the people aware of their problems and of the possible and alternative solutions to them. It also means enabling the people to take decisions, to try out solutions, to evaluate their progress and to modify their 
strategies, and so on, till the problems are solved. In this process, the 
bureaucracy certainly has an important role to play. But it has to be a 
subordinate role and the major task is still to be done by the people 
themselves through a nation-wide mass movement. While this is essential 
in every sector of development, it is absolutely necessary in sectors like 
education and health where progress is to be measured essentially in terms 
of individual awareness and growth. After all is said and done, health is 
as much a function of the mind as of the body and no system of health 
care services can succeed except through the willing and enthusiastic co-operation of the people. This can be secured only through a mass educational movement. Unfortunately, no such movements were ever organised (except to some extent in the control of communicable diseases) so 
that the health care systems did not really take off the ground in the 
proper sense of the term. The continuance of these policies will again lead 
to the same disastrous consequences. We must, therefore, plan our future 
programmes only on the basis of mass participation. 

### 8. Educational Aspects ###
The necessity for the massive involvement 
of the people in health care systems is best illustrated with reference to 
their educational aspects. For instance, it is necessary to educate all the 
people and every individual without exception — to unlearn the wrong 
concepts of health and disease, to understand the basic principles of 
hygiene, to discipline oneself, to learn to practise self-medication to the 
extent necessary, and to discharge all one’s personal responsibilities towards one’s own health. The people must also be trained to adopt mature 
attitudes to ageing, pain and death because it is the superstitions and 
irrationalities in these matters that form the fertile soil for the growth of 
most of what is wrong in the present systems. In this regard, the Indian
contribution of the concept of four ashrams is superb. Every one begins 
his life as a fondled child and then becomes successively a *Brahmachari* 
or a disciplined student, a *Grihastha* or house-holder when he drinks deep 
at the spring of life in all its fullness, a *Vanaprasthi* or a retiring and retired person, a *Sanyasi* who renounces the world and contemplates upon 
God, and finally gets ready to welcome death which becomes, not a terror, 
but a fulfilment in which the individual merges in the eternal and the 
absolute. To make every individual realise and practise this concept is 
equivalent to laying down the spiritual basis of health. That is essentially 
an educational task which we have to attempt. It is only in this direction 
that we can get the most effective, permanent and satisfying solutions to 
the problem of health. Let us not forget that drugs and doctors are mere 
palliatives and not solutions to the problem of health just as armaments 
and armies are no solutions to the problem of peace. In fact, there is no 
purely technological answer to the basic problems in life, and we cannot 
escape the need to provide spiritual solutions to them. A spiritual basis
on the lines indicated above is, therefore, inescapable for solving the problems of health care systems. Unfortunately we are not even aware of these 
dimensions of the problem. To create this awareness and to start moving 
in this direction can be one of the most worth-while alternatives to explore and implement. 

### 9. Pilot Projects ###
It is comparatively easy to reach an agreement on 
the negative conclusion that the existing systems of health care are unsatisfactory. But when it comes to the positive side, viz., development of 
a new system which would be more in keeping with our national needs 
and aspirations, it is not possible to reach the same unanimity. In fact, it is wrong to expect such unanimity which is not needed either. It is but natural that several alternatives might be proposed, that many of them would be viable, and that the differences between them may not be resolved by debate alone.
It is, therefore, necessary to adopt a pargmatic
approach and to allow trial and support several viable alternatives that meet certain criteria laid down. One thing must be said, however. Any pilot projects that we may undertake must have an adequate sacle, say, a whole district to cover. Very small projects may prove nothing; and even if they do, it will hardly be possible to generalize them.

Last year, the Indian Council of Medical Research organized, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Social Science Research, a Seminar on Alternative Systems of Health Care, especially for rural areas. A similar seminar was also organized at New Delhi by the All India Association for the Advancement of Medical Education. Between them, very valuable material has been made available about interesting experimental work now being done in several parts of the country. We have thus considerable experience and expertise in the field and a stage has, therefore, been reached when we can plan pilot projects of adequate size and try them in the Sixth Plan. If properly developed, this programme may enable us to solve the problems satisfactorily in the Seventh or Eighth Plan.

### 10. Expenditure ###
The financial aspects of the problem are extremely crucial and our choice of alternatives will depend, not only on their academic value, but on their financial implications as well. Here a few important issues need close examination.

(a) There is no adequate data about existing expenditure on health care systems, their quantum, sources, objectives, rate of growth and such other related but important matters. The distribution of this expenditure by different target groups is also not available. Such studies have, therefore, to be taken up on a priority basis.

(b) The existing expenditure on health care systems is inadequate and will have to be increased. From this point of view, we must prepare a perspective of growth over the next 15 years or so and make some realistic assumption for the Sixth Plan Period. We need a definite lobby to ask for a higher priority and a larger allocation for health.

(c) All possible economies must be effected and costs of health services should be brought down. Simultaneously, we should evolve techniques which increase efficiency and make every rupee go a very long way.

(d) We should permit only a limited increase in these aspects of expenditure on health services where the benefit goes to urban or well-to-do people. In fact, the manner in which a part of this expenditure can be transferred to urban communities or the beneficiaries themselves should be explored.

(e) The largest share of additional resource that become available should be set aside for taking the health care systems to rural areas or to the deprived sections.

## An Appeal ##

The ten broad principles enumerated above are, in my view, adequate guidelines to develop an alternative system of health care services for India. BUt we cannot stop with the mere enumeration of such principles. If concrete results are to be achieved, we must take two other steps:

1. *A large nation-wide debate* should be promoted on the failure of the existing system of health care services, on the reasons for its failure, and on the general principles and major programmes of the alternative system of health care which we must develop.

2. The Association should set up a competent group to prepare a *Draft Sixth Plan of Health Care Services in India* and submit it to the authorities concerned within one year from now. This will help us to clarify our own thinking and will shed new and valuable light on details which generally tend to be ignored. Quite obviously, such a plan will help in mobilizing public opinion and influencing official policy.

With all the emphasis at my command, I would appeal to the Association to take up these tasks. The Indian Council of Social Science Research would be happy to provide reasonable financial assistance from its project on 'Alternatives in Development'.

## Feasibility ##

An important quesiton will certainly be raised in this context: Will such radical alternatives be feasible or practicable in our sitatuion? Is the attempt worth while at all? Will it not mean a waste of resrouces (which are scarce) and of energy (which can be put to other uses)? These are important issues and need some discussion.

That there are immense difficulties in the development of these programmes is obvious. Among them, I might mention the following:

(a) The existing infrastructure and professional groups have become a big vested interest. It is necessary to make them aware of the issues involved and of the urgent need for alternatives. The most promising aspect of the problem is that there are several persons within the profession itself to extend this awareness of the select few to the profession as a whole and make it a willing and co-operative partner in the programme.

(b) Public opinion has to be education in favour of these changes. It is our best ally and hope. But the difficulties of doing so are immense, especially in our situation. In particular, we have to get the full moral and political support of the leadership among the weaker sections and deprived groups.

(c) The vested interests of the well-to-do and urban groups who hold the real reins of power would obviously be the biggest hurdle. An appeal should certainly be made to their role of trusteeship and to their enlightened self-interest.

Our instrumest to overcome the resistances of the vested interests and the creation of new forces which will support these programmes will be (1) educational propaganda, (2) an appeal to the good sense and social responsibility of the haves, and (3) strengthening of the demands of the have-nots. The first and the third are probably the most effective measures. The ultimate solution, therefore, lies in generating social and political forces which can take the needed decisions and implement them with determination and vigour. I, therefore, agree with Prof. Banerji that the ultimate decisions in health (as in education) are essentially political.

But where do we go from here? As Prof. C. T. Kurien has pointed out, the situation in India is different from that in the USSR or France. In the USSR, the socio-economic transformation has already taken place and hence the preparation of appropriate health care plans is easy. In France, also, the situation is equally easy because the French people are satisfied with their socio-economic system and do not want to change it. But we are in a different position. We live in the midst of a hierarchical and inegalitarian social order. In spite of all the resistance, we have to prepare alternative plans of development (the usual plans help the status quo) which will help the creation of an egalitarian society and use the plans themselves as instruments of the transfomration. This is a difficult but the only possible solution to the problem. Fortunately, it is not beyond a committed band of de-classed intellectuals and the emerging leadership from the masses.

Faced with these realities, I cannot conclude better than with the words of Bhavabhuti who divided all people into three categories: the lowest, the middle, and the highest. He said:

> The *lowest* do not begin for sheer fear of failure. The *middle ones* begin but stop as soon as difficult arise.
> The *highest* begin and never abandon, in spite of repeated blows from difficulties, till success is won.

The *problem* exists; we cannot escape it. The *difficulties* are undoubtedly great; we cannot ignore them. The only choice open to us is to decide which of these three categories of Bhavabhuti we shall join. I am afraid 
each one of us will have to answer the question for himself, with our conscience as the sole witness.
