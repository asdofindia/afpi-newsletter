Mr. A is an accountant in a reputed business firm of a metropolitan city. He was known for his ability for quick mental calculations, risk stratification and overall awareness of the stocks and commodities movement in his company. Although still in his late thirtys, he was considered an asset, and an icon for others to emulate in their respective fields.

During the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, he too was exposed, and suffered an excruciating illness, making him confined to his bed on most days. Although he did not need full scale hospital admission, he did consider Outpatient therapy with antivirals, steroids, and was under observation of his wife, who was from a medical background.

During the course of illness, he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, and was started on Night-time Basal Insulin, which later was tapered down to daily oral anti-diabetic drugs only. Having been aware, that both his parents were diabetics, he took the diagnosis of the so called “middle aged illness” with a mature and positive frame. 

He completed his course of therapy, and appropriate isolation procedures.Soon, the routine seem to be getting back, but the juice of enthusiasm was lagging. He presumed his body was taking a little longer to recover, or rather it could be some underlying vitamin deficiency. 

Prior to the illness, he was a fairly active chap, going for jogging twice to thrice a week, climbed stairs, carried water to his house, and even played a weekend game. But now, his joints had become stiff, his back was on the verge of giving away, he huffed and puffed while he carried his water, and moreover he was always tired at the end of his day job, more than often sinking into his bed, unable to spend sufficient quality time with his family.

Talking about his job, the initial tingling sensation in his fingers gave way to slowing down his typing speed, incoherence to find letters on the keyboard, and the famed memory and problem solving skills were now covered with dust. He even had difficulty in speaking out words, and preferred telegraphic langauges/ non-verbal cues to communicate. He frequently complained of palpitations, blue mornings, disturbed sleep patterns and reduced his social interactions. His collegues were missing the old, bubbly and cheerful nature of their talented buddy.

This is the premise of Long-Covid syndrome. In our society, we come across so many such examples, who have been subjected to the after-effects of Covid illness, not necessarily culminating in mortality, rather leading to a chronic, indolent and lonely sufferings. These cases lack prompt recognition, evaluation, and appropriate therapeutic and rehabilitative care, with a humane touch. 

There are more than 200 odd symptoms described by post-covid patients, ranging from palpitations, chest discomforts, myalgia, fatigue, confusion and incoherence, commonly refered to as “brain fog”, disturbed psycho-motor skillls, fever, rashes, gastro-intestinal symptoms and even anxiety-depression episodes.

The underlying patho-physiological mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The probable factors could be generalized (sub-clinical) inflammation, local inflammations as in bronchial/myocardial inflammation, or underlying vitamin deficiencies, unmasking of underlying potentials for metabolic syndromes, or even genetic predisposition or rather upregulation of genes dealing with inflammation and aging, or down regulation of genes for repair, healing and anti-ageing. The need for research, and its critical analysis are being looked forward with baited breath.

There have been studies published in Lancet and Eclinical medicine, which evaluated subjects for the usual vitals, basic blood tests, ecg and radiology, and were dejected to find almost normal results, including the extended tests of Iron profile and vitamin levels. This begs the question: are we looking at the wrong places ? should we change our measuring yardsticks ? or should we consider this physiology as the new medical normal ? 
Only time, and more research will tell.

As a Family Physician, we could start off by first recognising the possibility of Long-Covid syndrome, and its allies like post-viral myalgia, etc as a genuine medical entity. We need to have an open mind, and a keen ear to listen to the patients extended history, record the basic evaluation findings, offer the secnd line investigations based on the affordability and clinical utility on a case to case basis. 

The therapy is multi-dimensional and multi-departmental. It may include, but not restricted to underlying deficiency corrections, alleviation of the physiological pain and suffering through supervised medications, evaluation by Dietitian, and if needed Specilaists, and adequate one-on-one session with Psycho-social therapists.

Can we do something for prevention: The simplest answer is by prevention of Covid itself ! Wearing of masks, practising adequate social distancing, hand hygiene and taking our vaccinations at times. 

In these testing Stranger times, we are always on guard, as the Virus is an actively evolving entity, learning the tricks of trade, and growing every day. And so are we. Its just the matter, who blinks the first, how much one can endure, and if we would be the one, making our final mistake !
