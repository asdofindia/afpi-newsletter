Ayushman Bharat - the name resonates with the spirit of health empowerment — so is the scheme!

Famously also known as “Modicare”, it is the world largest healthcare system and it has been 3 years since its revelation.

The scheme has 2 elements:

1. **Health wellness centres based on  prevention is better  than cure**: The centres provide primary, outpatient care and referral access to secondary and tertiary health care when needed.

2. **Health insurance scheme - in secondary and tertiary care**. Aims to provide free access to health insurance coverage for low-income earners in the country. Almost 55 crore people can be benefited with 5 lakh rupees per family per year as promised in this scheme in empanelled hospitals, both public and private. 
 
In 2018 there were millions of Indians who were pushed below the poverty line for primarily one sole reason - they did not have sufficient income to spend on their health.
With the quest to reduce the medical expense burden on families the government came up with the above zealous scheme. 

We have a very ambitious and inspiring prime minister and more so his projects and schemes reflect his progressive thought process. The same is with the revolutionary scheme released under the name of AYUSHMAN BHARATH.

This article brings to you a neutral perspective and possibly an eye-opener for the ones who are willing to give a thought around this article and promote what's best available for our patients.

### Who is eligible under this scheme?

| **Rural** | **Urban** |
|---        |---        |
|Labourers |Rag Pickers |
|Scheduled Tribes And Scheduled Castes|Beggars|
|Landless Households|Street Vendors|
|Scavengers|Construction Workers And Security Guards Etc.|

### The primary question to all my compatriots here- do you know what the ayushman bharat scheme is?

Most of the medical population have just heard about this and assume – “ it may be just another project on the national front”. I remember in a gathering of medical associates some of the medical faculty was not even aware that it is a medical scheme!!! Hence This article brings to you all in simple terms- what Ayushman Bharat is and why as doctors we need to make the medical world in India aware of the same.

Let me share a short scenario - A daily wage worker - a diabetic - unable to get medications for himself - lands up finally amputee, as his leg turns gangrenous, the sole breadwinner now has to beg on streets to earn a living.
 
This is just a small glimpse into the window of the world of the downtrodden, there are many lakhs such below poverty line families devoid of medical help and eventually disappear without being heard by anyone at all.

### Brief about Jan Aushadi Kendras

**The biggest scheme easily available now under ayushman bharat is called  Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jana Aushadhi Pariyojana**, the sole purpose of this scheme is to get medications for every household for affordable prices through exclusive outlets called Jan ayushadi Kendra .
This scheme was launched on 23rd Sep 2014 and to date  8012 KENDRA’S  are functional across the country with 1451 essential drugs available and 240 surgical items.

National sample survey says 72% of the economy goes into the expenditure of medicine procurement.
 
### What do we get in jan aushadhi kendra?

Am sure the medical practitioners would not have had the time to look into the hoardings of our PM at some medical outlets, but those are jan aushadhi kendras which sell GENERIC MEDICATIONS.

The ones that we have learnt from our professors to prescribe from our college times are BRAND medications - which also the medical representative comes along with his handbags filled with catalogues to push us to sell through our prescriptions.

The Brand names (pharmaceutical industry) have to bear the brunt of their company marketing expenses, taxes, warehouse storage expenses, staffing finances, etc and naturally, have to cap the price of their medications almost 3 times that of the generic medications.

But imagine if every doctor in our country could mobilise generic medications, there would be so much more saved in every household to make a better living.

The intention of this scheme is beautiful, overwhelming or I would say heartening and definitely inspiring BUT there is always a ROADBLOCK when something has to be achieved and that is ITS IMPLEMENTATION !!!

### Who and what is the roadblock to jan aushadhi kendra?

You would be surprised to know but the roadblock to its implementation is the medical fraternity itself!!!

And why you may ask ??

Well, ask any doctor randomly ” doc what is Jan aushadhi Kendra ?”  You may get an abnormal pause and then “Ahmmm.. A national scheme ?? ”  period !!
Ok so is there anywhere around? Answer - well maybe you need to check in a government setup. 

Well, the point that I wanted to make up there was simply that we doctors need to know the policies the government is churning out in order to take it forward till the patient. If the doctor does not know about the medical scheme the entire benefit dies out even before it is born and nurtured.


### Many misconceptions about Jan Aushadhi Kendra !!!

Yes, many PRIVATE PHARMACISTS  PURSUE THE PATIENT TO BUY MEDICATIONS AT THEIR STORES RATHER THAN JAN AUSHADI KENDRAS. 
AND WHY?
They claim the medications at Jan aushadi Kendra is ineffective and that’s why they are sold cheap !!

It's dismaying that fellow Indians have to do this to lure customers but the fact is the jan aushadhi medications work well, have undergone necessary standardised quality checks, available in affordable prices for both rich and poor.

After utilising this scheme for many months now, I am Sharing personal feedback here - your patients would not only be happy with the treatment but also the money they have actually saved over time. 
Else they would have had to spend thousands at the private pharmacy procuring medications out of your prescription. 

The implication of easily available and affordable medications goes a long way in getting good compliance from a patient perspective and reducing the financial burden on the family altogether.

### WHY DO WE NOT SEE MANY PRIVATE HOSPITALS PARTICIPATING IN THE AYUSHMAN BHARATH HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME??

Reason: The government reimbursement rates are as low as 11-15 per cent of the actual costs of surgeries or procedures.
For example, if a tooth removal costs Rs X amount, the government is willing to pay only half of the X amount for the procedure, the hospital has to bear the extra costs by itself, then why would the private hospital want to be a part of this scheme. 
Under this health protection scheme, the proposed rates of over 1,350 surgeries and procedures are 15-20 per cent lower than Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS). The cost of therapies range anywhere between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh
An aortic arch replacement under cardiothoracic surgery would cost around Rs 15 lakh in a tertiary care hospital, which the government, under Ayushman Bharat, is offering for Rs 1.5 lakh.
A well-known chairman and managing director of a tertiary care hospital echoed the concerns of such reduced prices given by the government  “The rates, which the government has offered, are not realistic. They haven’t calculated our overhead expenditures,” he said. These hospitals are also unhappy with the delayed cycle of payments under the existing CGHS.
“Government takes six months to one year to pay our reimbursements for treatments under CGHS. We don’t want to get into another scheme unless government assures us that the payments are made within 15 days,” said a senior official at a leading Delhi hospital.
However, the government said it is voluntary for hospitals to participate in the scheme, due to rates that are not agreeable by private hospitals and slow payments by the government we find only a few hospitals attached to this scheme.  


### STATE GOVERNMENT SCHEMES - INITIATED  BY DIFFERENT STATE RULING PARTIES OTHER THAN THE AYUSHMAN BHARAT.

STATE SCHEMES ALREADY EXIST  IN A FEW STATES AND HENCE DO NOT SEE THE REQUIREMENT OF ADOPTING AYUSHMAN BHARAT COMPLETELY AS YET! FEW STATES HAVE STARTED COLLABORATING PARTIALLY IN ORDER TO SHARE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN.

Tamil Nadu
CMCHIS - Chief Minister's Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (Amma Health Insurance)
Delhi
Mohalla clinics - provides free medications and a few diagnostic tests free
Delhi Arogya Kosh schemes
 
Bengal
swasthya sathi scheme
 
Telangana
Basti clinics - free clinic and few diagnostic tests free
 
Rajasthan
 Independent Rajasthan medical service corporation, Free medicine distribution.

Kerala
Improve service infrastructure of existing clinics
“KARUNYA AROGYA SURAKSHA PADHATHI (KASP) has now collaborated with Ayushman Bharat scheme.


### PROBLEMS AT GROUND LEVEL- 

* Primary care in health wellness centres are not being promoted nor been adopted by private hospitals as they have their own health check departments to promote and run which costs way more than the government primary care packages, also the number of screening programs are more comprehensive and versatile in private hospitals than the government health wellness centres. 

* In order to make use of the Ayushman Bharat scheme benefits, a person must be hospitalised for at least more than one day, daycare charges are not applicable. Unless the beneficiaries are not hospitalized and just prescribed general medicines, 

* Issues such as constraints on movement, limits on elective operations, reluctance from scheme users to attend hospitals owing to fear of infection, classification of public institutions as special Covid centres have a considerable influence on the yojana’s effectiveness.

* Due to a lack of adequate knowledge, many are not able to avail the scheme benefit. Not many are confident in promoting generic medications from Jan aushadhi kendras and the apprehensions have not to be addressed by the government clearly.

* Last year nearly 111 hospitals were shamed for malpractices with this scheme. 

* Before the lockdown, 51% of the empanelled hospitals were operational. This percentage decreased to 25% during the late lockdown phase, the number of active hospitals REDUCED by over 40% 
* Small and medium-sized hospitals with less than 100 beds were the most hit. 

* Fear of getting COVID-19 infection among hospital owners and employees, or fear of being stigmatised and losing business if they treat COVID-19 patients the staff have reduced hospital visits, with reduced manpower the burden of the ill population is higher on government hospitals again.

* Registration in this scheme is mostly online and most of the underprivileged do not have access to the portal to understand and use the benefits.

* PRIVATE HOSPITALS AND PHARMACEUTICALS WILL DEFINITELY  NOT WANT TO PROMOTE GOVERNMENT SCHEMES THAT WOULD INCUR LOSSES TO THEIR COMPANIES!!

### MISUSE OF SCHEME - 

There has been misuse of the Ayushman Bharat scheme by private hospitals through the submission of fake medical bills.
Under the Scheme, surgeries have been claimed to be performed on persons who had been discharged long ago and dialysis has been shown as performed at hospitals not having kidney transplant facilities. 
There are at least 697 fake cases in Uttarakhand state alone, where a fine of 1 Crore has been imposed on hospitals for frauds under the Scheme.
Despite all efforts to curb foul-play, the risk of fraud entities profiteering from this system is clearly present in AB-PMJAY and needs transparency for the common man to put his faith in this system. 

### CURRENT STATUS OF THE SCHEME WITH IMPROVED INITIATIVES ANNOUNCED RECENTLY !!

Under medical management procedures, the rates for ICU with ventilator support has been revised by 100 per cent and without ventilator by 136 per cent, while the rates for HDU (High Dependency Unit) has been revised by 22 per cent and the prices for routine ward has been revised by 17 per cent. 
Rate revision in radiation oncology procedures, medical management procedures like those for dengue, acute febrile illness etc, surgical package treatment for black fungus, and other procedures like right/left heart catheterization, PDA closure, arthrodesis, cholecystectomy, appendicectomy etc. also has been done.

Currently, Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY covers 1,669 treatment procedures out of which 1,080 are surgical, 588 medical and one unspecified package.

### Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission!!

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission, one of the largest pan-India schemes for strengthening healthcare infrastructure, from his parliamentary constituency Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh on Monday.

The prime minister also inaugurated various development projects worth more than Rs 5,200 crore for his constituency.

Its objective is to fill gaps in public health infrastructure, especially in critical care facilities and primary care in both urban and rural areas. It will provide support for 17,788 rural health and wellness centres in 10 high focus states. Further, 11,024 urban health and wellness centres will be established in all the states.

Through this, critical care services will be available in all the districts of the country with more than five lakh populations through exclusive critical care hospital blocks, while the remaining districts will be covered through referral services.

People will have access to a full range of diagnostic services in the public healthcare system through a network of laboratories across the country, and integrated public health labs will be set up in all the districts.

This scheme acknowledges the Right to Medicine and the Right to be Treated well, especially impacting the lives of millions of families who are dying due to ill health.
 
Remember, We are the Gateways for the benefit of national schemes to be introduced to the population that come to us for treatment. It's important that we as healthcare professionals have the necessary awareness and information to take national schemes forward to people, when people start using these schemes and mobilising provisions the government is providing, there is always a consideration in government boardrooms to take the scheme to the next level rather than scraping it as a whole.
